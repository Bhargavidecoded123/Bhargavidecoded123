# Bhargavi Pissay

Hi there, I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Business Analytics at the University of Minnesota - Carlson School of Management and graduating in August 2025. With a background in software development and hands-on experience in data science, I’m passionate about working with data to uncover insights, solve real-world problems, and support strategic decision-making.

## A Little About Me

Over the past few years, I’ve built a strong foundation in analytics, combining technical skills with a business-first mindset. Whether it's wrangling large datasets, building predictive models, or creating dashboards that tell a clear story, I enjoy digging into the details and connecting them to the bigger picture.

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at Oracle Health and also contributed to real-world analytics projects during my time at Carlson. I value collaboration, curiosity, and continuous learning—especially in fast-paced, data-driven environments.
